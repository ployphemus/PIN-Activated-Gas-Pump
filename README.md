# PIN Activated Gas Pump

## PGP

## Description 
A simple gas pump kiosk program with PIN based authenication.
Made to be super simple for fleet use. Will keep track of 
gas dispenced per PIN, tank level, and gas added. Customers can
also add money to their accounts beforehand so they can access pump
in a faster and more efficient manner rather than paying every time 
they want to access pump. Can log
automated alerts to admin when tank gets low and shut off pump.
Program is intended to be firmware that is easily deployed and 
extended to cover multiple tanks and pumps. Will access external 
gas price api to calculate cost when new fuel is delivered.
